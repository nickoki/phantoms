## Functionality

**2: Performing**

> Application contains no major errors

Really like how you came up with a unique solution to a creative problem - I can see this app being super useful!

I'd recommend looking into CanCanCan if you want a fairly flexible solution for user auth. PaperClip is an excellent gem for file uploads, though if you're in production you'll need to set up cloud hosting with a service like AWS. Redcarpet / coderay are great for working with markdown.

> Submission includes everything in previous category, as well as evidence of planning tools, such as Trello, and, incorporates workflows such as feature branching, code review, github issue / user story tracking, and justification of technical decisions.
